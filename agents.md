If adding a new command, make sure to add it to the /gokibothelp command. Check if the user running this command is a dev or not. Split the commands into dev and not dev. If the user is not a dev, only print the non-dev commands. If the user is a dev, print all commands.

If I need too add an entry to the .env file let me know on the output of the prompt.
If I require additional configuration to my raspberry pi such as .env changes or system binarys or venv changes, please let me know.
